thou shalt have no other gods before me
honour thy father and thy mother
remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image
thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not commit adultery
thou shalt not steal
thou shalt not bear false witness against they neighbour
thou shalt not covet
